Contributing
=============

Welcome and thank you for your interest in contributing to Efik!

# Getting-started

You must sign a [Contribution License Agreement (CLA)](./doc/contribution-license-agreement.md) before your PR will be merged. 
This a one-time requirement for MAPAL Software projects on GitHub. You can read more about [Contribution License Agreements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement) on Wikipedia.

However, you don't have to do this up-front; you can simply clone, fork, and submit your pull-request as usual.

When your pull-request is created, if the change is trivial (i.e. you just fixed a typo) then the PR can be merge.
Otherwise, once you have signed a CLA, the current and all future pull-requests will be labeled as cla-signed.

Signing the CLA might sound scary but it's actually very simple and can be done in less than a minute.
